# Write a function named isIncreasing that takes a list of integers as a parameter. isIncraasing should return True if it continually increases. That is given a parameter list L, then L[0] < L[1] < L[2] etc. otherwise return False.
# if all of them are true then that means that the thing is countisuly adding

# ------------------- Question 2 ----------------
# some brief description of what the output should be
# Write a function named NumConvert. It should take a list of single digit numbers and convert it to an integer and return it.


# For example NumConvert([3,5,1]) would return the number 351.

  result = ""

  result = (int(result) )

# Assume all items in the list are positive single digits.

# If you are totally stuck on this, DM me on Zulip and I will provide a hint but you wonâ€™t be able to get full credit if you take the hint.
